Some ideas I would like to expand into full-sized posts, in no particular order:

- least surprise, sane defaults
    - weaponized: dark patterns (free trials, free returns)
    - toolized: swtiching your defaults
- system 1 and system 2. S1 is a bunch of binaries you don't ave the source for,
  S2 is newer code. You can only write for S2, and even if you manage to compile
  it's hard to optimize it to the point S1 is
- Using the right number of dimensions
    - color palettes, pie charts, Tufte
    - PCA
        - Alignment chart and the "political compass" are moral PCA, Haidt system is a higher dimensional
          version
- plants are made of air
- vim tricks
