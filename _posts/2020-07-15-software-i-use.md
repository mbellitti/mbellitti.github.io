I love vi keybindings. 

# OS and Desktop
My main machine runs Ubuntu 20.04 with i3wm. 

Ubuntu is a popular distro, with excellent hardware support. I don't like their obsession with snaps, so I will probably have to migrate away soon.

i3wm is pure window management bliss. I configured it to have vi-like keybindings.

# Text Editing
I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). It feels like vim, but fixes some odd quirks that I could never quite get to work reliably (mostly colorscheme issues). 

My favorite colorscheme is [vim-monochrome](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome). The visual mode highlight color is just beautiful.

# Web Browsing
My main browser is Firefox. I also like to use [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) (it has vi keybindings!), when I need a quick answer.

The two most important addons I use are [Imagus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/imagus/) and [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/). 

I also have a [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) set up at home, but mostly because I had a pi zero lying around that was sitting unused.

# Note Taking
I don't have a general purpose note system I find natural, but for science related matters my current workflow is:

1. Rough handwritten notes using a Wacom intuos S (it works fine, but a slightly larger one would be more comfortable) and [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)
2. Once I understand enough the topic I type up some clean notes using Neovim+vimtex+[zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) (Guess what? zathura has vi keybindings!). This combination provides forward and backward search from the LaTeX source to the pdf.
